                        As an IT student, my primary goal is to excel in my field by acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to be an effective employee. 
                        I aim to build a solid foundation that will allow me to eventually choose a clear field or industry I am passionate about.

                        My motivation comes from the chance to constantly learn and grow. A few years ago, I didn’t know much about programming, but now I’m able to build samll projects and see results. 
                        I also love learning different perspectives and working with talented people. In addition to that, my desire to give back to my family and loved ones also keeps me driven. 
                        Ultimately, I hope to find a balance where I can pursue my passion for technology while also exploring and enjoying various activities around the world.
